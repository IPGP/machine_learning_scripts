# machine_learning_scripts

This working groups mainly is inspired from the online book [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org) Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville.

### Course 1 (Nov, 24)

 * Read part 5.1
 * **dataset**: data points/features/design matrix
 * **learning algorithm**: task, performance, experience, classification, regression, supervised, unsupervised

### Course 2 (Dec, 2)
 
* Read part 5.2 (Capacity, overfitting and underfitting, The No Free Lunch Theorem, Regularization)
* Skimmed trough part 5.3 (Hyperparameters and Validation Sets)

### Course 3 (Jan, 13)

* Read part 3.13 (information, entropy, KL divergence)
* Read 5.5 (loss, maximum likelihood)

### Cours 4 (Jan, 20) 

* Started wirking with SCIKIT-LEAN on real datasets
* linear regression on SCARDEC database [scardec_analysis.py](scardec/scardec_analysis.py)
